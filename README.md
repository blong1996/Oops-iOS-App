# TMCF-Hackathon

This iOS Application was created during the TMCF 2016 OFC Hackathon in Atlanta, GA by the following team members:

Brandon Long - Computer Science & Mathematics - North Carolina A&T - Jr
Cortez Campbell - Criminal Justice & Psychology - Coppin State University - Jr
Henry Akaeze - Computer Science & Mathematics - Mississippi V. State University - Jr
Tache Johnson -  Computer Science & Mathematics - Cheyney University - Jr

This application called Oops! is a math learning application that influences students to actually workout problems on their own, rather than
just be provided with the solution the way most math apps do currently.

This project uses Swift, Facebook API, and CocoaPods. 

All teammates were either new to iOS development or coding in general.
